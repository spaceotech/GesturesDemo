# GesturesDemo
Android gestures help developers to build fluent and articulate Android apps. Although your app should not depend on touch gestures for basic behaviors (since the gestures may not be available to all users in all contexts), adding touch-based interaction to your app can greatly increase its usefulness and appeal.

After knowing all these, we decided to create a demo on it and published a tutorial to [How to Create In-App Customized Android Gestures With Minimal Coding Experience](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-gestures-app-tutorial/).

If you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to [hire Android app developer](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-android-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
